    "# Why Use the threading Module:\n",
    "## Improved Responsiveness: Multithreading allows programs to remain responsive, especially for long-running tasks. For instance, the UI can stay active while a file downloads in the background on a separate thread, enhancing user experience.\n",
    "## Efficient CPU Utilization: Modern CPUs often have multiple cores that can execute instructions simultaneously. By distributing work among these cores (using multiple threads), programs can potentially execute faster, particularly for tasks that can be broken down into independent subtasks.\n",
    "## Simplified Management of Concurrent Activities: Multithreading provides a structured approach for handling multiple activities within a program, making program flow and communication between threads easier to manage.\n",
    "## 1.activeCount():Purpose: Returns the total number of active thread objects (including the main thread).\n",
    "## Usage: This function is helpful for monitoring the number of currently running threads in your application. It can be used for debugging, resource management, or ensuring all threads have finished before program termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.currentThread(): Purpose: Returns the currently executing thread object.\n",
    "## Usage: This function can be used to identify the current thread within your code. It's often unnecessary for typical multithreading tasks, but it can be useful for debugging or logging purposes to understand which thread is executing a particular code block\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.enumerate() :Purpose: Returns a list of all currently active thread objects (including the main thread).\n",
    "## Usage: This function is useful for getting an overview of all running threads in your application. It can be used for debugging, monitoring thread execution, or managing thread resources.\n"
